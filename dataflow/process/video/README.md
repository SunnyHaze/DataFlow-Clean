# Video Data Processing

## 1. Pure Video Data Evaluation

### ðŸ‘€ 1.1 Dataset Preparation
Users can store the metadata of the dataset in the following JSON format:
```json
[
    {
        "flickr_id": 8536919744
    },
    {
        "flickr_id": 6408325533
    },
    {
        "flickr_id": 5319047612
    },
    {
        "flickr_id": 8724380666
    },
    {
        "flickr_id": 4744073127
    }
]
```

### ðŸŒŸ 1.2 Writing the YAML Configuration File

Create a YAML configuration file for the dataset mentioned in section 1.1. The configuration under `data` specifies the dataset path and related information, and the configuration under `scorers` specifies the evaluation metrics you wish to use.

```yaml
model_cache_path: '../ckpt' # Path to cache models
num_workers: 2
dependencies: [video]
save_path: './example.jsonl'

  video:
    meta_data_path: 'demos/video_process/video5data.json' # Path to meta data (mainly for image or video data)
    data_path: 'demos/video_process/videos/' # Path to dataset
    formatter: 'PureVideoFormatter' # Specify the data formatter

      max_size: null                                          # maximum allowed for the longer edge of resized frames

      any_or_all: any                                         # keep this sample when any/all videos meet the filter condition

```

### ðŸ’ª 1.3 Evaluating the Dataset
You can process (filter) the dataset with a single line of command
```bash
python process.py --config configs/process/video_process.yaml
```
Output is default stored in:
```
./scores.json
```
Output is in the following format:
```jsonl
{"flickr_id": 6408325533}
{"flickr_id": 5319047612}
{"flickr_id": 8724380666}
{"flickr_id": 4744073127}
```

### ðŸŒŸ 2.2 Writing the YAML Configuration File
Create a YAML configuration file for the dataset mentioned in section 2.1. The configuration under `data` specifies the dataset path and related information, and the configuration under `scorers` specifies the evaluation metrics you wish to use.

```yaml
model_cache_path: '../ckpt' # Path to cache models
num_workers: 2
dependencies: [video]
save_path: './example.jsonl'

  video_caption:
    meta_data_path: 'demos/video_process/videocap5data.json' # Path to meta data (mainly for image or video data)
    data_path: 'demos/video_process/video-caption/'
    formatter: 'VideoCaptionFormatter'  # formatter for video-caption evaluation

### ðŸ’ª 2.3 Evaluating the Dataset
You can process (filter) the dataset with a single line of command
```bash
python process.py --config configs/process/video_text_process.yaml
