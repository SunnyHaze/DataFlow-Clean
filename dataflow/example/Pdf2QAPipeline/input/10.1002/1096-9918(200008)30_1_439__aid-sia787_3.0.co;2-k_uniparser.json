Behnke, T. Strunskus and F. Faupel Lehrstuhl f\u00a8ur Materialverbunde, Technische Fakult\u00a8at, Universit\u00a8at Kiel, Kaiserstr. 2, 24143 Kiel, Germany\n\nWe developed a method to determine condensation coef\ufb01cients, C, of noble metals on polymer surfaces and to determine cluster sizes by means of XPS only, or in combination with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The surface concentration of the adatoms was determined using a mathematical correction of the XPS intensity that takes into account cluster growth of the noble metals on the polymer surfaces. We establish our method with experimental results of C for Cu and Ag on pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA)\u20134,40-oxydianiline (ODA) polyimide, bisphenol-A polycarbonate, trimethylcyclohexane bisphenol-A polycarbonate, polystyrene and Te\ufb02on AF 1601. Values of C for Ag determined with the XPS method agree well with those of radiotracer measurements. The condensation coef\ufb01cient varies by three orders of magnitude from 1 to 0.002, depending on the deposition parameters and properties of the adsorbents. The method can be applied in general to investigate the deposition of non-wetting metals on solid surfaces.

In general, the properties of metal/polymer interfaces are determined by the interac- tion between the metal and the polymer and by the mor- phology of the interface. Noble metals and other metals of low reactivity do not wet untreated polymer surfaces but form three-dimensional spherical clusters on it, i.e. they exhibit a Volmer\u2013Weber growth mode.1,2 The clus- ter density depends on the deposition parameters as well as on the metal\u2013polymer interaction and is in the range 1010\u20131013 cm 2.\n\nThe condensation coef\ufb01cient C is de\ufb01ned as the ratio of the number of adsorbed metal atoms to the total number of metal atoms arriving at the surface.3 Determination of condensation coef\ufb01cients of metals by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is trivial if the measured XPS inten- sity of a metal peak is proportional to the total number of metal atoms deposited on a surface. This condition is ful\ufb01lled for the \ufb01rst monolayer in a layer-by-layer growth mode but not in the case of clusters growing on a surface. In this case it is necessary to make some considerations and calculations to take into account the appreciable self- attenuation of the XPS intensity by the metal clusters.\n\nStudying the condensation coef\ufb01cient is not only useful to estimate the adhesion properties of metals on polymers after different surface treatments, but also to determine the chemical interaction between metal atoms and polymers\n\n* Correspondence to: V.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to determine the growth parameters and to provide important information for the correction of the XPS data. The XPS measurements for Ag were checked by a comparison to the results obtained by a very sensitive radiotracer technique, which has been described recently in Ref. 5.\n\nWe choose the system of Cu evaporated onto pyro- mellitic dianhydride (PMDA)\u20134,40-oxydianiline (ODA) polyimide to introduce the method. Finally, we present condensation coef\ufb01cients for Cu and Ag on several amor- phous polymer substrates and describe their correlation with the morphological properties of the metal at an early stage of the deposition process.\n\nThe polymer \ufb01lms were prepared either by spin-coating or casting from solution onto an Si wafer. For TEM investi- gations, thin electron-transparent \ufb01lms of 20\u201330 nm thick- ness were deposited by vapour deposition of Te\ufb02on AF or\n\nco-deposition of both PMDA and ODA onto TEM meshes covered with a 10 nm amorphous carbon layer. Prior to metal deposition, all polymer \ufb01lms were cured for a few hours in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) at a temperature close to their glass transition temperature Tg and checked with XPS. After curing, the spin-coated and vapour-deposited \ufb01lms are very similar in their chemical composition.\n\nThe metals were evaporated from heated molybdenum crucibles mounted in the preparation chamber of the pho- toelectron spectrometer. Pressure during evaporation and analysis was held below p < 5 \u00f010 7 Pa. The deposition rate R and the nominal \ufb01lm thickness Hnom D Rt were monitored by a water-cooled quartz crystal microbalance, which was calibrated gravimetrically. The nominal \ufb01lm thickness is a measure of the amount of metal evaporated onto the surface. For the determination of condensation coef\ufb01cients, XPS intensities of the metal were measured on substrates where C is known to be very close to unity,5 i.e. a polyimide at room temperature or a clean metal sub- strate. This intensity acts as a point of reference and makes the connection to the nominal thickness monitored by the quartz microbalance.\n\nThe XPS investigations were performed in situ using a hemispherical electron analyser (VSW EA 125) and a non-monochromatized Mg K\u02db (Al K\u02db) x-ray source (VG Microtech XR3E2). All XPS measurements were done with electron emission normal to the sample surface. The XPS peak areas that were used to calculate C were obtained after a Shirley-type background removal using the pre-installed SPECTRA software.\n\nMicrographs of the metal/polymer interface were taken with a transmission electron microscope (Philips CM 30) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Bright-\ufb01eld pictures obtained with a CCD camera were edited subsequently with standard graphic software.\n\n\\begin{title}\nNOVEL METHOD TO DETERMINE CONDENSATION COEFFICIENTS FROM XPS MEASUREMENTS\n\\end{title}\n\nAccording to the de\ufb01nition of C that has been given in the introduction, and the typical quanti\ufb01cation model of XPS,6 the approach to determine C as the ratio of the number of adsorbed metal atoms Nc to the total number of metal of impinged atoms Nt is\n\n\\begin{equation}\nC ( t )=N_{c} ( t ) / N_{\\mathrm{t}} ( t )=[ I_{c} ( t ) S_{\\mathrm{a}} / K_{\\mathrm{c}} ( t ) ] / ( I_{\\mathrm{s t d}} S_{\\mathrm{s t d}} / K_{\\mathrm{s t d}} ) \\quad( 1 )\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere Sa and Sstd are the sensitivity factors containing both element-speci\ufb01c and instrument-dependent terms, Ic and Istd are the background-subtracted peak intensities for the analysed sample and for a standard sample (with C D 1) that are prepared at the same deposition rate of the metal and are measured under the same conditions of the photoelectron spectrometer (the latter allows us to assume that Sa D Sstd) and Kc and Kstd are the correction factors that are used to correct the XPS intensity due to attenuation by the metal.\n\nAs mentioned above, noble metals grow as spherical clusters on polymer surfaces. From the formalism that has been suggested in Ref. 7 it is possible to calculate the intensity I of the photoemission signal from a single spherical cluster as\n\n\\begin{equation}\nI=\\pi\\lambda^{3} \\{( r / \\lambda)^{2}+[ ( 2 r / \\lambda+1 ) \\mathrm{e}^{-2 r / \\lambda}-1 ] / 2\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{token}\n\u25b72\u25c1\n\\end{token}\n\nwhere r is the radius of the cluster and is the inelastic mean free path (IMFP) of the photoelectrons. According to Ref. 8 the correction for elastic scattering effects becomes important in the analysis of overlayers with characteristic depths more than the IMFP. For this purpose, instead of the IMFP the attenuation length (AL) was used, as sug- gested in Ref. 8. For small r the right-hand side reduces to the cluster volume 4 r3/3, and the photoemission inten- sity is proportional to the number of atoms. For r \u00d7 , I tends to r2 , and the signal is proportional to the clus- ter\u2019s projected area because only the photoelectrons from the surface region of the cluster are detected.\n\nBecause of this behaviour, the determination of C requires a correction of the measured XPS intensities in the case of cluster growth. We calculate a correction factor K by dividing one big metal cluster into many (n) small pieces with an equivalent total mass. For each of these clusters self-attenuation becomes negligible as their size approaches the size of one metal atom. A comparison of the intensities n\u00d0Ir< /Ir> results in K. A plot of the correction factor K versus the cluster radius r is depicted in Fig. 1. For a single atom the correction factor approaches unity. The bigger r, the lower K, i.e. the more correction the XPS signal gets. The application of K on the experimental intensities Iexp results in corrected intensities according to\n\n\\begin{equation}\nI_{\\mathrm{c o r r}}=I_{\\mathrm{e x p}} / ( 1 / K )\n\\end{equation}\n\nand consequently the in\ufb02uence of spherical cluster growth is eliminated. Corrected intensity Icorr is a measure of the actual amount of metal atoms on the surface and can be used to calculate C. The size of the metallic clusters can be measured directly by TEM but, due to contrast and focus- ing limitations, it is dif\ufb01cult to determine accurate sizes for small clusters exhibiting radii in the range 0.5\u20132 nm, the most interesting size range for the determination of con- densation coef\ufb01cients in the initial stages of \ufb01lm growth. Also, the preparation of transparent polymer samples for TEM is a dif\ufb01cult problem. Therefore, to determine the cluster size for small clusters we introduced an indirect method that is based on the measurement of the ratio of two XPS lines of the same metal with different bind- ing energies and their different attenuation lengths. The determination of r from the intensity ratio is based on\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 1. Dependence of correction factor K of the XPS intensity on the radius of clusters normalized to (as de\ufb01ned in the text).\n\\end{caption}\n\n\\begin{token}\n\u25b73\u25c1\n\\end{token}\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{array} {c} {{( I_{1} / I_{2} )=( \\lambda_{1} / \\lambda_{2} )^{3} ( r / \\lambda_{1} )^{2}+[ ( 2 r / \\lambda_{1}+1 ) e^{-2 r / \\lambda_{1}}-1 ] /}} \\\\ {{( r / \\lambda_{2} )^{2}+[ ( 2 r / \\lambda_{2}+1 ) e^{-2 r / \\lambda_{2}}-1 ]}} \\end{array}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{token}\n\u25b74\u25c1\n\\end{token}\n\nThe dependence of the ratio I1/I2 for the Cu 3p and the Cu 2p lines on the cluster radius is shown in Fig. 2, using either IMFP or AL for in the calculation. In the case of very small clusters on a surface the self-attenuation of the photoemission signal in the clusters becomes more and more negligible. For clusters with radii much larger than , e.g. 10\u201320 nm, the intensity ratios are the same as obtained for bulk samples. But for small clusters one can estimate the mean cluster size using the XPS inten- sity ratio of two lines of the clustered element from plots like Fig. 2. The results were checked by comparing the value of K obtained directly by XPS measurement (mean size value) and calculation of K from measurement of cluster size and the size distribution from TEM measure- ments. The discrepancy for the Cu/PI system was \u00be30%. The validity of our calculated correction factor K was also checked by another experiment where Cu was evap- orated onto PMDA\u2013ODA polyimide at room temperature in small steps with a constant deposition rate R (where C D 15). The experimental Cu 2p photoemission inten- sity for nominal \ufb01lm thicknesses (Rt) from 0.01 up to 1 nm is shown in Fig. 3. Owing to attenuation of the photoelectrons in the clusters, the photoemission intensity rises slowly, particularly at higher coverages. In the same graph the linear evolution of the intensity calculated by using the correction factor K in Eqn (3) and either AL or IMPF in Eqn (2) is shown. To determine K, \ufb01rst the cluster radius was obtained from the measured Cu 3p/Cu 2p intensity ratio from the plots shown in Fig. 2 using either AL or IMFP. Then, with this cluster radius, K is obtained from the plot shown in Fig. 1. Finally, using this value of K, the experimental intensity is corrected accord- ing to Eqn (3). The calculation using the AL from Ref. 9 shows very good agreement with the line determined for a condensation coef\ufb01cient of unity. From this it follows that the corrected values correspond to the actual amount of metal atoms deposited onto the surface.\n\nTo examine the accuracy of the XPS determination of C, the measured XPS data for Ag on different polymer\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 2.

The condensation coef\ufb01cients at room temperature are found to depend strongly on the chemical composition of the polymer surface and particularly on the interaction between the metal and the polymer.\n\nAs can be seen from Table 1, there are two modes of condensation at room temperature: \u2018complete\u2019 conden- sation with C \u00be 1 for Cu and Ag on PMDA\u2013ODA polyimide and for Cu on bisphenol-A polycarbonate; and \u2018incomplete\u2019 condensation with C < 1 for polystyrene and Te\ufb02on AF. Both the polyimide and the polycarbon- ate contain carbonyl groups, polystyrene does not but has\n\n\\begin{legend}\na\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 4.

It was shown in a previous paper that there are large differ- ences in the metal nucleation processes between polyimide and the other polymers.4 In the case of the polyimide the interaction is stronger than van der Waals and the carbonyl groups are active sites for random nucleation of the adatoms. It appears that copper shows a similar behaviour on bisphenol-A polycarbonate. For polymers with small C (weak interaction), preferred nucleation at different active (defect) sites able to trap metal atoms is observed. Therefore, C shows a correlation with the num- ber of defects generated by argon ion bombardment on the Te\ufb02on AF surface. Even for very low doses of 3 and 6 \u00f0 1012 ions cm 2, the condensation coef\ufb01cient of Cu increases from 0.02 for the untreated te\ufb02on surface to 0.05 and 0.1, respectively. All metal atoms initially adsorb on the te\ufb02on surface, but due to the very low adsorption energy and the small cluster density most of the adatoms (except those trapped at defects) readily desorb again.5\n\nThe correlation between re-emission probability and nucleation process on the surface is demonstrated by the temperature dependence of C. In Fig. 4 the cluster density of Cu on PMDA\u2013ODA polyimide is shown for two temperatures. Corresponding values for C are determined as described above. At 250 \u00b0C the condensation coef\ufb01cient is still very close to unity and it decreases substantially above 300 \u00b0C. This drop and correlation with cluster density (Nc) suggests that the re-emission probability of metal atoms is strongly affected by the nucleation process on the surface. At increasing temperature, Nc decreases and the root-mean-square displacement of the adatom from the arrival site before re-emission becomes\n\n\\begin{title}\nREFERENCES\n\\end{title}\n\n1.

Note that an increase of the systematic error in the XPS measurement is possible if C is determined for elevated temperatures, particularly above the glass transition temperature, due to a possible diffusion of the metal adatoms into the bulk of the polymer.11 In this case comparison to radiotracer measurements allows us to estimate the effect of bulk diffusion on the condensation coef\ufb01cient.\n\n\\begin{title}\nCONCLUSION\n\\end{title}\n\nIt was shown that with XPS it is possible to determine condensation coef\ufb01cients of metals on polymers if the interfacial morphology is taken into account. The cor- rection procedure for the XPS intensity in the case of spherical clusters of noble metals on non-wetting surfaces has been tested using several methods. The results of the XPS measurements on the condensation coef\ufb01cient of Ag agreed well with radiotracer measurements.\n\nA large variation of the condensation coef\ufb01cient C of noble metals is observed for different polymers and a smaller one for the metals. The condensation coef\ufb01- cient ranges from close to unity to values of the order of 10 3, depending on the type of polymer and the metal. For copper, C was almost unity on polymers with car- bonyl groups, whereas on polycarbonate, C was found to depend strongly on the chemical reactivity of the metal. It was shown that the morphology of the \ufb01lms and C are correlated through the nucleation process. At elevated temperature the cluster density decreases and at the same time C decreases also.\n\n\\begin{legend}\nb)\n\\end{legend}\n\n3. Venables JA. Surf. Sci. 1994; 299/300: 798.\n\n4.

The surface concentration of the adatoms was determined using a mathematical correction of the XPS intensity that takes into account cluster growth of the noble metals on the polymer surfaces. We establish our method with experimental results of C for Cu and Ag on pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA)\u20134,40-oxydianiline (ODA) polyimide, bisphenol-A polycarbonate, trimethylcyclohexane bisphenol-A polycarbonate, polystyrene and Te\ufb02on AF 1601. Values of C for Ag determined with the XPS method agree well with those of radiotracer measurements. The condensation coef\ufb01cient varies by three orders of magnitude from 1 to 0.002, depending on the deposition parameters and properties of the adsorbents. The method can be applied in general to investigate the deposition of non-wetting metals on solid surfaces. Copyright \uf6d92000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n"

According to Ref. 8 the correction for elastic scattering effects becomes important in the analysis of overlayers with characteristic depths more than the IMFP. For this purpose, instead of the IMFP the attenuation length (AL) was used, as sug- gested in Ref. 8. For small r the right-hand side reduces to the cluster volume 4 r3/3, and the photoemission inten- sity is proportional to the number of atoms.

In the case of very small clusters on a surface the self-attenuation of the photoemission signal in the clusters becomes more and more negligible. For clusters with radii much larger than , e.g. 10\u201320 nm, the intensity ratios are the same as obtained for bulk samples. But for small clusters one can estimate the mean cluster size using the XPS inten- sity ratio of two lines of the clustered element from plots like Fig. 2. The results were checked by comparing the value of K obtained directly by XPS measurement (mean size value) and calculation of K from measurement of cluster size and the size distribution from TEM measure- ments. The discrepancy for the Cu/PI system was \u00be30%. The validity of our calculated correction factor K was also checked by another experiment where Cu was evap- orated onto PMDA\u2013ODA polyimide at room temperature in small steps with a constant deposition rate R (where C D 15). The experimental Cu 2p photoemission inten- sity for nominal \ufb01lm thicknesses (Rt) from 0.01 up to 1 nm is shown in Fig. 3. Owing to attenuation of the photoelectrons in the clusters, the photoemission intensity rises slowly, particularly at higher coverages. In the same graph the linear evolution of the intensity calculated by using the correction factor K in Eqn (3) and either AL or IMPF in Eqn (2) is shown. To determine K, \ufb01rst the cluster radius was obtained from the measured Cu 3p/Cu 2p intensity ratio from the plots shown in Fig. 2 using either AL or IMFP. Then, with this cluster radius, K is obtained from the plot shown in Fig. 1. Finally, using this value of K, the experimental intensity is corrected accord- ing to Eqn (3). The calculation using the AL from Ref. 9 shows very good agreement with the line determined for a condensation coef\ufb01cient of unity. From this it follows that the corrected values correspond to the actual amount of metal atoms deposited onto the surface.\n"

It was shown in a previous paper that there are large differ- ences in the metal nucleation processes between polyimide and the other polymers.4 In the case of the polyimide the interaction is stronger than van der Waals and the carbonyl groups are active sites for random nucleation of the adatoms. It appears that copper shows a similar behaviour on bisphenol-A polycarbonate. For polymers with small C (weak interaction), preferred nucleation at different active (defect) sites able to trap metal atoms is observed. Therefore, C shows a correlation with the num- ber of defects generated by argon ion bombardment on the Te\ufb02on AF surface. Even for very low doses of 3 and 6 \u00f0 1012 ions cm 2, the condensation coef\ufb01cient of Cu increases from 0.02 for the untreated te\ufb02on surface to 0.05 and 0.1, respectively. All metal atoms initially adsorb on the te\ufb02on surface, but due to the very low adsorption energy and the small cluster density most of the adatoms (except those trapped at defects) readily desorb again.5\n"
