Box 105, Kyungki-Do, South Korea 440-600\n\nReceived 20 September 1999; accepted 12 October 1999\n\nABSTRACT: Fluorinated and chloro\ufb02uorinated polyimides with high thermal stability and low optical absorption loss in the optical communication wavelengths of 1.3 and 1.55 mm were investigated for low-loss passive waveguide applications. These polyim- ides were prepared from pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) with 1,4-bis-[4-amino-2- (tri\ufb02uoromethyl)phenoxy]tetra\ufb02uorobenzene (ATPT), 1,4-bis-[4-amino-2-(tri\ufb02uorom- ethyl)phenoxy]benzene (ATPB), and 1,3-bis-[4-amino-2-(tri\ufb02uoromethyl)phenoxy]-4,6- dichlorobenzene (ATPD). Control of the refractive indices of the polymers was achieved from 1.5397\u20131.5671 for TE polarization and 1.5239\u20131.5513 for TM polarization at 1.55 mm by copolymerization of PMDA/ATPT and PMDA/ATPB. As the amount of PMDA/ ATPT was increased, the refractive indices of the polymers were decreased. Rib-type optical waveguides were fabricated using these \ufb02uorinated polyimides. These waveguides exhibited a low propagation loss of less than 0.5 dB/cm at 1.55 mm. \u00a9 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

In this arti- cle, we describe the synthesis and characteriza- tion of a series of \ufb02uorinated and chloro\ufb02uori- nated polyimides which exhibit good thermal stability, a controllable refractive index, and low optical loss in the optical communication wavelengths of 1.3 and 1.55 mm. The fabrication of waveguides by using these polyimides and characterization of their optical properties are also demonstrated.\n\n\\begin{title}\nEXPERIMENTAL\n\\end{title}\n\n\\begin{title}\nMaterials\n\\end{title}\n\nTetra\ufb02uoro-1,4-hydroquinone (Apollo Scienti\ufb01c), 2-chloro-5-nitrobenzotri\ufb02uoride (Aldrich), potas- sium carbonate (Aldrich), tetra-n-butylammonium chloride (Fluka), and 10% Pd/C (Kojima Chem.) were used as received. Hydroquinone (Kanto Chem.) and pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA; Al- drich) were recrystallized from toluene and acetone, respectively. 4,6-Dichlororesorcinol (Aldrich) was puri\ufb01ed by sublimation under reduced pressure prior to use. N,N9-Dimethylacetamide (DMAc; Al- drich) was puri\ufb01ed by distillation under reduced pressure over calcium hydride.\n\n\\begin{title}\nMonomer Synthesis10\n\\end{title}\n\n\\begin{title}\n1,4-Bis-[4-nitro-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]tetra- fluorobenzene\n\\end{title}\n\nTetra\ufb02uoro-1,4-hydroquinone (2.76 g, 0.015 mol), 6.91 g of potassium carbonate, and 40 mL of DMAc were placed under nitrogen in a 250-mL round- bottom \ufb02ask. 2-Chloro-5-nitrobenzotri\ufb02uoride (7.52 g, 0.033 mol), 0.098 g of tetra-n-butylammonium chloride, and 0.020 g of copper powder was then introduced into the reactor. The mixture was heated to 80\u00b0C for 17 h and then \ufb01ltered to remove the copper powder. The \ufb01ltered solution was precip- itated in 500 mL of methanol\u2013water (1:1 by vol- ume). The resulting precipitate was collected by \ufb01ltration and washed with 1.5 L of distilled water. After the precipitate was dissolved in tetrahydrofu- ran (THF), the solution was dried over magnesium sulfate. After removal of THF, the crude product was puri\ufb01ed by recrystallization from glacial acetic acid. The yield was 5.51 g (65%).\n\n1H-NMR (acetone-d): d 6.7\u20137.3 ppm (6H, aromatic).

After the \ufb02ask was evac-\n\nuated, hydrogen gas was injected into the reac- tion mixture. The above procedure was repeated several times and the reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. Then, the solution was \ufb01ltered through celite to remove Pd/C. The \ufb01ltered solution was poured into 200 mL of n-hexane to precipitate the white com- pound. It was dried at 50\u00b0C under reduced pres- sure to 4.772 g (76.3% yield).\n\n1H-NMR (acetone-d): d 6.8\u20136.9 ppm (d, 2H, aromatic), (6.9\u20137.0 ppm (d, 2H, aromatic), (7.1\u20137.2 ppm (s, 2H, aro- matic), and (4.9\u20135.0 ppm, (s, 4H, \u2014NH2).

A series of copolyimides were prepared from the two amines, ATPT and ATPB, with PMDA. The con- tent of ATPT was varied (20\u201380 mol % based on ATPB). The resulting poly(amic acid) solutions were \ufb01ltered through a 1.0-mm Te\ufb02on \ufb01lter and then spun-coated onto a silicon wafer, followed by curing at 80\u00b0C/2 h, 160\u00b0C/1 h, 250\u00b0C/0.5 h, 300\u00b0C/ 0.5 h, and 350\u00b0C/0.5 h.\n\n\\begin{title}\nWaveguide Fabrication\n\\end{title}\n\nRib-type optical waveguides were fabricated by spin coating an undercladding and a core polymer on an oxidized silicon substrate.

UV transparencies were measured by a Hewlett\u2013 Packard HP8453 spectrophotometer. Refractive indices of the polymer \ufb01lms were measured using a Metricon 2010 prism coupler using light from a 1.3-mm laser diode and a 1.55-mm laser diode. The inherent viscosities of the poly(amic acid) samples were measured with an Ubbelohde viscometer us- ing DMAc as a solvent. Near-infrared spectra of the polyimide \ufb01lms (180 mm thick) were recorded on an ATI Mattson In\ufb01nity FTIR spectrometer. The near-\ufb01eld mode pattern and loss of the waveguides were recorded using a 1.55-mm laser diode. The incident light beam was introduced to the waveguides through a single mode \ufb01ber with mode-\ufb01eld diameter of 10 mm. The propagation loss of the straight waveguides was measured by the cutback method.11 The output beam power intensity was measured with an Anritsu optical power meter.\n\n\\begin{title}\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\\end{title}\n\n\\begin{title}\nSynthesis of Monomer\n\\end{title}\n\nThe diamines, 1,4-bis-[4-amino-2-(tri\ufb02uoromethyl)- phenoxy]tetra\ufb02uorobenzene (ATPT), 2,29,6,69-1,4- bis-[4-amino-2-tri\ufb02uoromethyl)phenoxy]benzene (ATPB), and 4-bis-[4-amino-2-(tri\ufb02uoromethyl)phe- noxy]-2,4-dichlorobenzene (ATPD), were synthe- sized in two steps by the reaction of 2-chloro-5- nitrobenzotri\ufb02uoride with tetra\ufb02uorohydroqui- none, hydroquinone, and 3,5-dichloronitrobenzene,\n\nAr':\n\nrespectively, followed by reduction of the corre- sponding nitro compounds with hydrogen in the presence of Pd/C. The structures of the nitro and diamine compounds were con\ufb01rmed by 1H-NMR and IR. After reduction, absorption peaks from the nitro group at 1333 and 1488 cm21 disappeared and peaks from the primary amine at 3400 and 3490 cm21 were observed in the IR spectra. In the1H- NMR spectra, the primary amine signal around 4.95 ppm was observed after reduction.\n\n\\begin{title}\nPreparation of Polymers and Their Thermal Properties\n\\end{title}\n\nFluorinated and chloro\ufb02uorinated polyimides were synthesized from PMDA, ATPT, and ATPB. The copolyimides were prepared from the two amines, ATPT and ATPB, with PMDA. The con- tent of ATPT was varied (20\u201380 mol % based on ATPB) as shown in Scheme 1. The intrinsic vis- cosities of the resulting poly(amic acid) were be- tween 1.8 and 2.3 dL/g measured at 30\u00b0C in DMAc, exhibiting the high molecular weights of these polymers. The measured glass transition temperatures of three kinds of polyimides are shown in Table I. As shown in this table, Tg in- creases in the order of PMDA/ATPT . PMDA/ ATPD . PMDA/ATPB. It seems that halogen sub- stitutents cause the decrease of the \ufb02exibility of the polymer chain (prevent rotation along the chain) and the increase of intermolecular interac- tion due to the increasing polarity of the polymer backbone. The thermal decomposition tempera- tures are shown in Figure 1. It is observed that the decomposition starts at a lower temperature\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nCc1c(F)c(F)c(C)c(F)c1F\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nCc1ccc(C)cc1\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{molecule}\nCc1cc(C)c(Cl)cc1Cl\n\\end{molecule}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nTable I Thermal Properties of the Polymers\n\\end{caption}\n\n\\begin{table}\n| Polymer   | T ()   | Onset Temperature of Weight Loss (\u2103)   |\n|:----------|:-------|:---------------------------------------|\n| PMDA/ATPT | 309    | 522                                    |\n| PMDA/ATPB | 292    | 537                                    |\n| PMDA/ATPD | 298    | 495                                    |\n\\end{table}\n\na Determined by DSC at a heating rate of 20\u00b0C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere. b Determined by TGA at a heating rate of 10\u00b0C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere.\n\nby halogen substitution.

The carbon\u2013hydrogen (C\u2014H) and oxy- gen\u2013hydrogen (O\u2014H) bonds are reported to strongly affect the absorption in the near-infrared region.13 The low absorption in both the 1.3- and 1.55-mm wavelengths, which are used in optical\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 1 TGA thermograms of polyimides with a heating rate of 10\u00b0C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere.\n\\end{caption}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 2 Near-infrared spectra of the polyimides.\n\\end{caption}\n\ncommunications, is an important consideration in using these polymers for optical devices. It is also reported that the absorption due to C\u2014H bonds can be reduced by the replacement of hydrogen in the C\u2014H bonds to heavier atoms such as \ufb02uorine (F), chlorine (Cl), and deuterium (D).14,15 The ab- sorption in the near-infrared region, therefore, is strongly related to the number of C\u2014H bonds in the polymer. The smaller the number of C\u2014H bonds in the polymer, the lower the absorption in the near-infrared region. Figure 2 shows the near-infrared absorption spectra of PMDA/ATPB and PMDA/ATPT polyimide \ufb01lms. As expected, the absorption of PMDA/ATPT is smaller than that of PMDA/ATPB due to the smaller number of C\u2014H bonds in this material.\n\n\\begin{title}\nRefractive Index and Birefringence\n\\end{title}\n\nThe in-plane (nTE) and out-of-plane (nTM) refrac- tive indices and the birefringence (the difference between nTE and nTM) of the \ufb01lms were deter- mined with a prism coupler.16 These are shown in Table II. The \ufb01lms were prepared by spin coating\n\n\\begin{caption}\nTable II Refractive Indices of Polyimide Film\n\\end{caption}\n\n\\begin{table}\n| Polyimides   | nTE    | nTM    | Birefringence (nTE\u2212nTM)   |\n|:-------------|:-------|:-------|:--------------------------|\n| PMDAATPT     | 1.5397 | 1.5239 | 0.0158                    |\n| PMDAATPB     | 1.5671 | 1.5513 | 0.0158                    |\n| PMDA/ATPD    | 1.5727 | 1.5670 | 0.0057                    |\n\\end{table}\n\na Determined by Metricon 2010 prism coupler using a 1.55-mm laser diode.\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 3 Refractive indices of \ufb02uorinated copolyim- ides at 1.55 mm.\n\\end{caption}\n\npoly(amic acid) solutions onto silicon wafers and then backed to 350\u00b0C under a nitrogen atmo- sphere. The \ufb01lm thicknesses were between 10 and 12 mm. It is known that the refractive indices, and, therefore, the birefringence, in polyimide \ufb01lms are affected by several factors. These factors include the chain \ufb02exibility and linearity, geom- etry of the repeat units, and polarizability and orientation of the bonds in the polymer backbone. As shown in Table II, the nTE is larger than is nTM in every case. This is due to the rigid aromatic molecules, which tend to align in parallel with the \ufb01lm surface during the \ufb01lm processing. Due to this ordering, light travels slower (higher refrac- tive index) in the in-plane direction compared with the out-of-plane direction. The nTE\u2019s and nTM\u2019s of \ufb01lms tend to increase in the order of PMDA/ATPD . PMDA/ATPB . PMDA/ATPT, which is consistent with the increasing order of polarizability. It is known that refractive indices of \ufb02uorine-containing polymers are smaller than those of un\ufb02uorinated polymers due to the smaller polarizability of the carbon\u2013\ufb02uorine bond (C\u2014F) compared to that of the carbon\u2013hydrogen (C\u2014H) bond. Because the polarizability of car-\n\n\\begin{legend}\nSpin coating the cladding and the core\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{legend}\nPhotolithography\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 4 SEM image of core ridges.\n\\end{caption}\n\nbon\u2013chlorine (C\u2014Cl) is larger than that of the C\u2014H bond,17 and light travels slower through more polarizable bonds, the refractive index of the chlorine-containing polymer, PMDA/ATPD, is the largest among the polymers. Note that the bire- fringence of PMDA/ATPD is the smallest. This is attributed to the kink structure of this polymer, and this structure prevents in-plane orientation.\n\n\\begin{title}\nRefractive Index Control of Polymers\n\\end{title}\n\nBecause optical waveguides consist of a light-car- rying core (high refractive index) and a cladding (low refractive index), one of the important re- quirements for an optical polymer is precise con- trol of the refractive indices for them. It was re- ported that the copolymerization of different \ufb02u- orine content-containing monomers provides good methodology to control the refractive indices of polymers for waveguide applications. We copoly- merized PMDA with two different diamines, ATPT and ATPB. As shown in Figure 3, the re- fractive indices of the polymers decreased linearly as the amount of the more \ufb02uorinated diamine, ATPT, increased to 1.55 mm for both in-plane (TE)\n\n\\begin{legend}\nPlasma etching\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{legend}\nSpin coating the upper cladding\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 5 Near-\ufb01eld mode pattern for TE polarized light at 1.55 mm.\n\\end{caption}\n\nand out-of-plane (TM) polarizations. We were able to control the refractive indices of the poly- mers in the range of 1.5397\u20131.5671 for TE polar- ization and 1.5239\u20131.5513 for TM polarization at 1.55 mm by copolymerization of PMDA/ATPT and PMDA/ATPB.\n\n\\begin{title}\nFabrication and Characterization of Rib-Type Waveguides\n\\end{title}\n\nRib-type optical waveguides were fabricated by using \ufb02uorinated copolymers. An undercladding layer (PMDA/ATPT, nTE 5 1.5420, nTM 5 1.5211, and 18 mm thick) and a core layer (PMDA/ATPT: PMDA/ATPB 5 4:6, nTE 5 1.5597, nTM 5 1.5397, and 4.4 mm thick) were spin-coated onto an oxi- dized silicon substrate. Core ridges (1.6 mm depth and 6 mm width) were then formed by conven- tional photolithography and dry etching. Waveguides were fabricated by covering the core ridges with an overcladding polymer (20 mm thick) by spin coating as shown in Scheme 2. Figure 4 shows a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the core ridge of the waveguides. The smooth etch pro\ufb01le could be achieved by this plasma-etching process. The propagation loss of the straight waveguides at 1.55 mm was mea- sured by the cutback method. Less than 0.5 dB/cm of propagation loss was measured in a 6-mm-width waveguide at 1.55 mm. Figure 5 shows the near-\ufb01eld mode pattern of the waveguide (6 mm width), demonstrating a single mode at 1.55 mm. Details of the waveguide struc- ture and the performance of the optical device will be reported elsewhere.\n\n\\begin{title}\nCONCLUSIONS\n\\end{title}\n\nThe \ufb02uorinated polyimides with good thermal stability, refractive index controllability, and low optical loss at the optical telecommunication wavelengths of 1.3 and 1.55 mm were synthesized. The refractive indices of the polymers were con- trolled by copolymerization of PMDA with two different \ufb02uorine-containing diamines, ATPT and ATPB. The refractive indices of polymers de- creased as the amount of ATPT increased and could be controlled in the range of 1.5397\u20131.5671 for TE polarization and 1.5239\u20131.5513 for TM polarization at 1.55 mm.

These polyim- ides were prepared from pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) with 1,4-bis-[4-amino-2- (tri\ufb02uoromethyl)phenoxy]tetra\ufb02uorobenzene (ATPT), 1,4-bis-[4-amino-2-(tri\ufb02uorom- ethyl)phenoxy]benzene (ATPB), and 1,3-bis-[4-amino-2-(tri\ufb02uoromethyl)phenoxy]-4,6- dichlorobenzene (ATPD). Control of the refractive indices of the polymers was achieved from 1.5397\u20131.5671 for TE polarization and 1.5239\u20131.5513 for TM polarization at 1.55 mm by copolymerization of PMDA/ATPT and PMDA/ATPB. As the amount of PMDA/ ATPT was increased, the refractive indices of the polymers were decreased. Rib-type optical waveguides were fabricated using these \ufb02uorinated polyimides. These waveguides exhibited a low propagation loss of less than 0.5 dB/cm at 1.55 mm. \u00a9 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 77: 2172\u20132177, 2000\n"

In this arti- cle, we describe the synthesis and characteriza- tion of a series of \ufb02uorinated and chloro\ufb02uori- nated polyimides which exhibit good thermal stability, a controllable refractive index, and low optical loss in the optical communication wavelengths of 1.3 and 1.55 mm. The fabrication of waveguides by using these polyimides and characterization of their optical properties are also demonstrated.\n"

The con- tent of ATPT was varied (20\u201380 mol % based on ATPB) as shown in Scheme 1. The intrinsic vis- cosities of the resulting poly(amic acid) were be- tween 1.8 and 2.3 dL/g measured at 30\u00b0C in DMAc, exhibiting the high molecular weights of these polymers. The measured glass transition temperatures of three kinds of polyimides are shown in Table I. As shown in this table, Tg in- creases in the order of PMDA/ATPT . PMDA/ ATPD . PMDA/ATPB. It seems that halogen sub- stitutents cause the decrease of the \ufb02exibility of the polymer chain (prevent rotation along the chain) and the increase of intermolecular interac- tion due to the increasing polarity of the polymer backbone. The thermal decomposition tempera- tures are shown in Figure 1. It is observed that the decomposition starts at a lower temperature\n"

It is known that the refractive indices, and, therefore, the birefringence, in polyimide \ufb01lms are affected by several factors. These factors include the chain \ufb02exibility and linearity, geom- etry of the repeat units, and polarizability and orientation of the bonds in the polymer backbone. As shown in Table II, the nTE is larger than is nTM in every case. This is due to the rigid aromatic molecules, which tend to align in parallel with the \ufb01lm surface during the \ufb01lm processing. Due to this ordering, light travels slower (higher refrac- tive index) in the in-plane direction compared with the out-of-plane direction. The nTE\u2019s and nTM\u2019s of \ufb01lms tend to increase in the order of PMDA/ATPD . PMDA/ATPB . PMDA/ATPT, which is consistent with the increasing order of polarizability. It is known that refractive indices of \ufb02uorine-containing polymers are smaller than those of un\ufb02uorinated polymers due to the smaller polarizability of the carbon\u2013\ufb02uorine bond (C\u2014F) compared to that of the carbon\u2013hydrogen (C\u2014H) bond.

Figure 4 shows a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the core ridge of the waveguides. The smooth etch pro\ufb01le could be achieved by this plasma-etching process. The propagation loss of the straight waveguides at 1.55 mm was mea- sured by the cutback method. Less than 0.5 dB/cm of propagation loss was measured in a 6-mm-width waveguide at 1.55 mm.
