The precursor polymers are then solvent cast to the desired form and thermally treated to cycloimidize the polymer, forming the \ufb01nal polyimides. Understand- ing the details of the imidization reaction is important to ensure optimal \ufb01nal properties and critical in the design of the processing window for good adhesion.\n\nIn the synthesis of the precursor polymer, the nu- cleophilic reaction on the dianhydride carbonyl may result in the addition of the diamine in the meta or para position, and the obtained poly(amic acid)s and poly- (amic ester)s actually are copolymers containing sev- eral repeat units. For instance, in polymerizations in- volving pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA), chain prop- agation results in both meta and para catenation; in the case of bridged dianhydrides, three different repeat unit isomers are formed during polymerization (for ex- ample, see Scheme 1). Theoretical considerations have led to the prediction that the isomerism of the repeat units has a effect on the cure behavior of the polymers and ultimately on the properties of the resulting poly- imides.1,2 This effect is predicted to arise from the relative dif\ufb01culty of bringing the amide functionality into the correct geometry to react with the OOH group\n\nCorrespondence to: W.

In this regard, Volksen et al. had investi- gated the isomerism of PMDA\u2013ODA based poly(amic ethyl ester)s and found that the meta-poly(amic ester)s have the advantage of having lower viscosity in concen- trated solution and higher imidization temperatures than the randomized chain.3 A similar observation on the tert-butyl esters of PMDA\u2013ODA poly(amic acid) indicated that the isomerism of the repeat units does not appear to have any detectable effect on the cure behavior of the polymer, although meta isomerism ap- pears to enhance solubility of the polymer in organic solvents.4\n\nTo gain a complete understanding of the imidization behavior of poly(amic ester) precursors and, in partic- ular, the effect that difference in polymer chain archi- tecture has on the ring-closing reaction, poly(amic methyl ester)s based on 3,39,4,49-biphenyl dianhydride (BPDA) and 4,49-oxydianiline (ODA) were chosen for the present thermal imidization study because this sys- tem exists more commonly for three possible different repeat units in precursor form and the BPDA-based polyimides possess such attractive properties that they have been become increasingly important in industry.\n\n\\begin{title}\nEXPERIMENTAL\n\\end{title}\n\nBPDA and ODA were puri\ufb01ed by sublimation before use. N,N-Dimethylacetamide (DMAc) was distilled un- der vacuum over P2O5, and thionyl chloride (SOCl2) was distilled under normal pressure and inert gas. Pyridine was used as received. Methanol was distilled under nitrogen from CaH2. BPDA dimethyl ester-di- acid (BPDE) was prepared by the reaction of BPDA\n\n\\begin{legend}\nq\n\\end{legend}\n\n\\begin{caption}\nScheme 1.

This is referred to as the mixed BPDE. Three isomers of BPDE were separated by frac- tional recrystallization.\n\n\\begin{title}\nIsomer Separation\n\\end{title}\n\nThe mixed BPDE (30.4 g) was suspended in ethyl ace- tate (500 mL) and re\ufb02uxed with stirring for about 10 h. The resulting suspension was \ufb01ltered. This procedure yielded (12.5 g) of hot ethyl acetate insoluble material corresponding mainly to the meta\u2013meta attached iso- mer (m,m-BPDE). The isomeric purity was ; 80%. Recrystallization of the meta\u2013meta isomer rich mate- rial from butyl acetate (; 100 mL) yielded 8.5 g of m,m-BPDE with an isomeric purity of more than 99%. The above ethyl acetate \ufb01ltrate was concentrated to about 100 mL and was kept overnight with refrigera- tion to afford 6.5 g of white crystals, corresponding mainly to the para\u2013para isomer (p,p-BPDE). The iso- meric purity was ; 90%. Recrystallization of the para\u2013 para isomer rich material from ethyl acetate (30 mL) yielded 3.8 g of p,p-BPDE with an isomeric purity of more than 99%. The second \ufb01ltrate was concentrated under vacuum until crystallization was initiated.

The heating rate was 10\u00b0C/min under nitrogen atmo- sphere. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) was carried out with a Du Pont 982 DMA at a heating rate of 3\u00b0C/min from room temperature to 450\u00b0C. The specimens used for DMTA were prepared by supporting poly(amic ester) on a glass braid and then being dried at 80\u00b0C for 1 day under vacuum. The imidized samples were obtained by heating at 300\u00b0C for 1 h under vacuum.\n\n\\begin{title}\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\\end{title}\n\nThe initial step for the synthesis of poly(amic methyl ester)s involves the esteri\ufb01cation of BPDA. Three diester-diacid isomers may appear as a result of the opening selectivity of anhydride groups toward the methanol (Scheme 2a). HPLC was used to separate the mixed BPDE, and three perfectly de\ufb01ned peaks con\ufb01rmed the presence of three isomers.6 The sepa- ration of three isomeric diester-diacids can be achieved by taking advantage of their different solu-\n\n\\begin{caption}\nFigure 1.

The struc- tures of three isomeric diester-diacids were identi\ufb01ed by 1H- and 13C-NMR measurements, and the assign- ments of the NMR spectra were facilitated by com- paring the spectrum of the isomer mixture to those of pure isomers.\n\nThe isomeric purity of the monomers, 100% for both m,m-isomer and p,p-isomer and 88% for the m,p-iso- mer, was veri\ufb01ed by HPLC, while mixed BPDE con- tains three isomers with a isomer ratio of m,m-BPDE: m,p-BPDE: p,p-BPDE 5 0.35 : 0.44 : 0.21. The aromatic diester-diacids were converted to the corresponding di- ester-diacyl chlorides by reacting with excess thionyl chloride (Scheme 2b). Consequently, the poly(amic methyl ester)s, mixed and three isomerically pure pre- cursor polymers, were prepared by the low-tempera- ture polymerization of ODA with the respective aro- matic diester-diacyl chloride in DMAc (Scheme 2c). The molecular weight of these isomeric poly(amic ester)s lies within the medium molecular weight range. DMTA\n\nhas been particularly helpful for understanding the physical processes that accompany the imidization re- action (Scheme 2d). Figure 1a,b shows \ufb02exural storage modulus and tan d traces of three isomeric poly(amic ester)s cured at 3\u00b0C/min from 50 to 400\u00b0C, respectively. Assignments regarding the processes occurring in each region of the thermogram are discussed below. There is a broad, weak peak in the tan d curve between 110 and 180\u00b0C, which may be attributed to the b relaxation of the polymers; at a higher temperature the a relaxation is accompanied by a sharp drop in the storage modulus, corresponding to the glass transition of the partially imidized polymers and followed by a modulus increase due to the further imidization of the more \ufb02exible free poly(amic ester). Further heating causes apparent modulus drops due to shrinkage of the samples and softening of the curing polymers. It is clear from Figure 1 that different isomers of the precursors have a strik- ing difference in the form of the DMTA trace. The meta\u2013meta-linked polymer exhibits the earliest modu- lus drop, i.e., the lowest a relaxation temperature with peak at 222\u00b0C, while that for meta\u2013para- and para\u2013 para-linked precursors is 232 and 256\u00b0C, respectively. The difference in the chain rigidity on the precursor backbone can be responsible for this observation. The meta\u2013meta-linked precursor, due to the position of at- tachment, has the most bent conformation among the three isomers and, hence, yields the best \ufb02exibility on the precursor backbone, lowering its Ta. The order of stiffness for these materials would decrease as the poly- mer goes from all para catenation to all meta.\n\nTable 1 compares some of the DMTA data from the polyimides obtained by thermal imidizing isomeric poly(amic ester)s at 300\u00b0C for 1 h. Tg values are ob- tained by the temperature at peak maximum of a re- laxation in the loss modulus curves. It is found that the Tg values of the polyimides from different poly(amic ester) isomers have a distinct difference. The polyimide\n\n\\begin{caption}\nTable I.

This difference cannot be attributed to the differences in molecular weight since the three isomeric precursors have similar molecular weight. Also, it can- not be accounted for by their possible differences in the imidization extent since, as con\ufb01rmed TGA below, all precursor polymers had converted completely to the polyimides after imidizing at 300\u00b0C. This behavior is most possibly due to the difference in their molecular orientations of the polymer chains. It is obvious that the most extended and ordered para\u2013para-linked poly- (amic methyl ester) precursor makes the obtained poly- imide have more highly ordered main chain structure as compared to those of the polyimides obtained from other two isomeric precursors. The more ordered units favor chain\u2013chain packing and therefore allow more interaction to occur, thereby resulting in the polymer having a higher Tg value.\n\nThe thermal imidization of isomeric poly(amic es- ter)s also was studied by TGA using a heating rate of 10\u00b0C/min from 50 to 650\u00b0C under nitrogen. All poly- mers showed two-step weight losses corresponding to the imidization process and thermal degradation. In the range 200\u2013350\u00b0C, all the polymers showed a weight loss about 13% corresponding to the loss of methanol during imidization. The second step on the TGA curves starts at a temperature above 500\u00b0C (5% weight loss around 550\u00b0C) and corresponds to the thermal degra- dation of the polyimides. Table 2 compares some of the data for isomeric poly(amic ester)s from their TGA curves with calculated weight losses for imidization. It is clear that the three isomeric precursors do not ap- pear to have any great differences in the imidization behavior, although the para\u2013para-linked precursor ex- hibits a slightly earlier onset of imidization.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that BPDA\u2013ODA- based poly(amic methyl ester)s can be prepared, as\n\npure para\u2013para-, para\u2013meta-, and meta\u2013meta-linked polymers in good yield. TGA showed that these iso- meric precursors do not appear to have any great dif- ference in the imidization behavior. Further imidiza- tion studies by DMTA have found that the isomerism of the repeating units has a distict effect on the glass transition temperatures of the precursors and obtained polyimides. The meta\u2013meta-linked polymer exhibits the lowest Tg, and the order of stiffness for three isomers is decreased as the polymer goes from all para catenation to all meta one. The difference for the obtained polyim- ides in Tg values was attributed to the difference in their molecular orientation of the polymer chains. Cur- rent work concentrates on a detailed investigation of the aggregation state of these materials by electronic spectroscopy.\n\n\\begin{title}\nREFERENCES AND NOTES\n\\end{title}\n\n1.

For instance, in polymerizations in- volving pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA), chain prop- agation results in both meta and para catenation; in the case of bridged dianhydrides, three different repeat unit isomers are formed during polymerization (for ex- ample, see Scheme 1). Theoretical considerations have led to the prediction that the isomerism of the repeat units has a effect on the cure behavior of the polymers and ultimately on the properties of the resulting poly- imides.1,2 This effect is predicted to arise from the relative dif\ufb01culty of bringing the amide functionality into the correct geometry to react with the OOH group\n"

Figure 1a,b shows \ufb02exural storage modulus and tan d traces of three isomeric poly(amic ester)s cured at 3\u00b0C/min from 50 to 400\u00b0C, respectively. Assignments regarding the processes occurring in each region of the thermogram are discussed below. There is a broad, weak peak in the tan d curve between 110 and 180\u00b0C, which may be attributed to the b relaxation of the polymers; at a higher temperature the a relaxation is accompanied by a sharp drop in the storage modulus, corresponding to the glass transition of the partially imidized polymers and followed by a modulus increase due to the further imidization of the more \ufb02exible free poly(amic ester). Further heating causes apparent modulus drops due to shrinkage of the samples and softening of the curing polymers. It is clear from Figure 1 that different isomers of the precursors have a strik- ing difference in the form of the DMTA trace. The meta\u2013meta-linked polymer exhibits the earliest modu- lus drop, i.e., the lowest a relaxation temperature with peak at 222\u00b0C, while that for meta\u2013para- and para\u2013 para-linked precursors is 232 and 256\u00b0C, respectively. The difference in the chain rigidity on the precursor backbone can be responsible for this observation. The meta\u2013meta-linked precursor, due to the position of at- tachment, has the most bent conformation among the three isomers and, hence, yields the best \ufb02exibility on the precursor backbone, lowering its Ta. The order of stiffness for these materials would decrease as the poly- mer goes from all para catenation to all meta.\n"
